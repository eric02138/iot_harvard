						(Before I became this horrible twisted thing.)<br><br>
						Look!  I found my Scholar website!  That takes me back.  Also, that's probably the best photo anyone has ever taken of me.<br><br>

						In fact, I used to be one of the organizers for ABCD-WWW.<br><br>

						But then I sold my soul to Mammon/Big Pharma.  Now I work at Vertex Pharmaceuticals building internal web apps.  I would have a slide with the Vertex logo, or a photo of our building downtown, but our legal department requires a review of the disclosure of any of our intellectual property.<br><br>
						
						So no logos. And no disclosure of anything sensitive.  Sorry.<br>

					<h3>Huh?</h3>
					<p>I thought you were here to talk about IoT at Vertex.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Well, sorta.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					(click for well, sorta)
					Every year Vertex has a hackathon, where groups of IT folks gather and are presented with a challenge.  IoT had been a hot topic for a bit, so we thought, "Let's give the teams an IoT challenge".  Gradually, this morphed from "Let's do something with Raspberry Pis" to "Let's do something with Raspberry Pis and eggs" to "Let's remotely control Pis to cook eggs" to "And bacon!  And Toast!"  And thus the idea for IoT Breakfast was born.<br><br>
					Later, when I told Raman about our hackathon, he said, "Cool!  Can you give an ABCD talk about it?"  And since saying no to Raman is like kicking a puppy, here I am.

					<h3>Challenge 1: Sorting Eggs</h3>
					<p>How can I tell if an egg is uncooked or hard-boiled?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					The first challenge we gave our teams was to present them with a basket of eggs, some of which were hard-boiled and some were uncooked, and they had to sort them. Any ideas about how you would do this?<br><br>
					Ok, now how would you make a machine that could do this?<br><br>
					We decided to use the "candling" technique. 
					</aside>

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/pi.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					In our case, the idea was to develop a means where a machine could do the determination, and notify us remotely.  So we took a Raspberry Pi (1)...

        				Now, using some python code shamelessly stolen from Adafruit's website, we can read how opaque a given egg is.  Especially when a flashlight was shined on them, hardboiled eggs had a significantly higher value, which meant they were blocking more light.

					<h3>Challenge 2: Cooking the Raw Eggs</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					In a lab setting, how do you boil an egg?  With this:
					</aside>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/hotplate.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Raise your hand if you know what this is.<br><br>
					This is a stirrer-hot plate.  We can heat up a solution and stir it at the same time.  As you can see, there are nobs and displays to operate the device manually.  But what you can't see is that there is a serial port on the back.  We were able to hook up the serial port to a raspberry pi.  Here's the awesome part: not only could you read the temperature data from the probe or see how fast the stirrer was spinning, you could also issue commands!  Which is probably a really bad idea to do remotely.  But we did it anyway. Because extremely hot liquid overflowing the sides of a beaker is hilarious.
					</aside>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h3>Challenge 3: Make Toast</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					Finally, we decided that we needed toast with our eggs.  By the way, I was all for cooking bacon as well.  But bacon was deemed A) too difficult to deal with and B) culturally insensitive to our muslim, jewish and vegetarian coworkers.					
					</aside>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/toaster.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					So we bought a few of the cheapest toasters off Amazon and encouraged folks to modify them so a servo could depress and release the lever.  By the way, is there a name for that thing?  Toaster lever?<br><br>
					Again, the idea was to hook a Pi up to the servo and have it operate the toaster remotely.  Amazingly, only one toaster exploded and an acceptable number of Vertexians were injured.

					(Hold up ethernet cable)  Here's the internet.  So if we attach the ethernet cable to the brick, we get an Internet thing.<br><br>
					But this way of connecting is becoming increasingly obsolete, to the extent that my mac doesn't even have an ethernet port.  Nowadays, you're supposed to be connecting wirelessly.<br><br>
					I'm only partially joking here. (NEXT)<br><br>

					Solar Roadways.  Sorry, I'm mispronouncing that.  (Click on link)<br><br>
					(NEXT)
					Ok, so Solar Freakin' Roadways turns out to be prohibitively expensive as the pilot installation in Sandpoint, Idaho cost roughly 60,000 dollars to install 30 panels.  And apparently they de-laminate in code weather, which I'm sure isn't a problem in Idaho.  
					<br><br>
					Also, apparently the fuse box caught fire.  But that's ok because an Iron Maiden fan in Australia was watching the Solar Roadways webcam, and he was able to alert the fire department.  In my imagination, he was listening to "Run to the Hills" at the time.  The Internet of Bricks has built-in failsafes it seems.

 					<aside class="notes">
					For example, this laptop consumes roughly 10 watts of power during regular use. With a battery capacity of 49 watt hours, that means I can work for about 5 hours at Crema Cafe before I need to recharge.  Interestingly, the battery capacity actually went down from 99 watt hours on the previous Macbook Pro.  Combined with all the other useless new "features" like the stupid touch bar and the USB-C ports, it's a hunk of junk.

					I bought this 3.7 volt rechargable Lithium Ion batteries for one of my Arduino projects.  It's small and light, and since it's rechargable, there's not the hassle of having to periodically buy new batteries.  Gradually these have lead to a transportation revolution.  More on that later.

 					This is a municipal wifi access point.  Increasingly, we demand universal connectivity.  You can see this demand in practice on the T.  On my ride from South Station to Harvard Square, my wireless signal cuts out right around Downtown Crossing and doesn't return until Charles/MGH.  When this happens, I look around and watch as one by one my fellow passengers get pissed off as they lose service.  You're underground people!  What do you expect?<br><br>

 					Here's an Arduino.  It costs around 25 bucks.  It's not quite a computer, but it can run on battery power.  It doesn't come with wifi natively but that can be added with the appropriate add-on shield.  (Interestingly wifi shield for Arduino are actually around $40 for some reason.)  Still, at $65 bucks, it's pretty cheap.

 					But that's not my point.  My point is, for the technology you're getting, this is stupid cheap.  You're getting a whole integrated circuit for less that $100!  That's incredible.  How is this possible?

 					Here's a little exercise.  I have two spice grinders I picked up at Trader Joes.  (Pass around)<br><br>
 					One has Himalayan Sea Salt, and the other had a blend of Peppercorns.  Any guesses on the price I paid for the salt?<br>
 					How about the pepper?<br>
 					The salt was $1.99 and the pepper was $2.99.  Just above the words that says "Himalayan Pink Sea Salt" can you read what the label says?  And you, just above the label that says "Rainbow Peppercorn"?<br>
 					So the salt was first mined in Pakistan, driven to a port, loaded onto a ship, shipped to South Africa, unloaded, driven to a packaging plant, driven back to port, reloaded onto a ship, shipped to California, unloaded and brought to Trader Joe's distribution center, then driven to my local Trader Joes.<br> 
 					And the peppercorns made a similar journey, though they first came from Brazil, India and Malaysia originally.  And somehow Trader Joes can sell these for a profit at $2 and $3, respectively.<br><br>
 					So what are some of the costs in producing these delicious spices?  Just shout out an answer.<br><br<
 					(Fuel, packaging, labor, physical assets, fees)<br><br>
 					What kind of physical assets?  Someone had to pay for that boat - presumably they eventually want to make a profit on it.  Warehousing.  Machinery.  And all of it has to be insured.  <br><br>
 					Who's involved with labor?<br><br>
 					(Miners, pickers, driers, drivers, port workers, forklift operators, sailors, managers, TJs executives)<br><br>
 					What is the most obvious way to reduce the cost of these products?

 					Here's a photo of some chinese electronics workers.  These guys are actually allowed a 30 minute post-lunch nap - apparently it makes them more productive.<br><br>
 					Although I'm sure they're also tired.  Here's a report from a 2014 BBC investigation:<br>
 					In December 2014 a BBC investigation exposed poor working conditions and employee mistreatment at Pegatron factories making Apple products near Shanghai.[12] It uncovered staff forced to work eighteen days straight without a day off, workers falling asleep on the production line during 12-hour shifts (sometimes 16 hours), forced overtime and dormitory rooms where 12 workers shared a cramped room.<br><br>
 					And these are the good jobs.  These are the jobs people are leaving the countryside in droves for.  The Economist recently had an article about how China was working to create new cities to accomodate all of these migrants.  So there's our answer - let's keep these people in mind next time we marvel at the low cost of a Raspberry Pi.

 					<aside class="notes">
					The consequences of globalization are the hardest to anticipate, because there's as many input factors as there are people.  Last year, global chocolate prices spiked due to a drought in West Africa and increased demand from a growing middle class in China.  As a result, Hershey's, Mars and Cadbury collectively ponied up $1 Billion to help increase cocoa production in Ghana.  Meanwhile, Starbucks is planning to open 2,500 stores in China by 2021, so we can expect global coffee prices to go up as supply is decreased.  What if there's an electronic DIY fad in China?  What will happen to our precious supply of Raspberry Pis?

 					As cost goes down, plan on seeing a scatter-gun approach to IoT.  The chairs you're sitting on don't have IoT devices in them, yet.  (Or do they?)  Once the cost of devices drops low enough, they might.  Facilities could monitor how they're arranged or if they've magically left the building.  They might tell a presenter that his audience is bored and squirming in their seats.<br>

 					Infrastructure is not sexy.  Paving roads isn't that interesting.  Unless they're - (Solar Freakin' Roadways)<br>
 					Networking, likewise, is not sexy.  But it's the backbone upon which the "I" in IoT rests.  Thankfully, advancements in networking, especially wireless networking are coming along nicely.  This is partially thanks to my friend Thomer Gil, who used to be the lead programmer of the mesh networking company Meraki.  If you haven't heard of them, that's because they sold the company to Cisco.  He now lives in a very nice house on a canal in Amsterdam.<br><br>
 					Interestingly, now that he's back home in Holland, he has become interested in automating Antwerp's industrial barge traffic.  Presumably, some wireless networking would be required.

 					<aside class="notes">
 					Today's rechargable batteries represent a revolution.  I regularly see electric skateboards on my ride to work these days.  They have a relatively simple bluetooth user interface, but they've already been hacked.<br><br>

 					Still, they're pretty neat.  I chatted with a guy on one of these skateboards - he was already looking forward to the new battery that's supposed to come out next year.<br><br>

 					But don't get me started on the people who ride electric assist bikes.<br><br>

 					Power management using IoT holds the promise of dramatic energy savings.  According to the Department of Energy, Heating and cooling account for about 48% of the energy use in a typical U.S. home, making it the largest energy expense for most homes.<br>
 					What if we had IoT "smart" homes?  For example, to keep the house cool in the summertime, the windowshades on the south and west-facing sides of your house could automatically be lowered, except when weather.gov said it was overcast.<br><br>

 					For commercial use, a room like this could be "pre-cooled" for this capacity crowd based on who rsvp-ed online.

 					The self-driving automobile is the Holy Grail of IoT.  There's so much money to made in self-driving cars and trucks that Amazon, Uber, Ford, GM, etcetera can't afford *not* to be heavily invested in this technology.<br><br>

 					While eliminating the driver for shipping purposes would dramatically decrease the cost of fulfillment for business, there is a downside. (first link)  As manufacturing moved overseas, driving a truck is one job that doesn't require a diploma and can't be outsourced.  What happens to all those truck drivers is anyone's guess.<br><br>

 					(second link)
 					Here's another statistic: 4%.  Your car is actually being driven about 4% of the time.  What if it drove itself?  You could lend out your car to other people while you weren't using it?  Maybe people stop owning cars altogether - maybe access to self-driving cars becomes a yearly subscription service.  And since all these cars are in use all the time, there's no need for parking spaces anymore.  What would we do with all the extra space?  What would we do with all the empty parking lots?
