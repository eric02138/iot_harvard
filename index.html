					<h2>The Internet of Things</h2>
					<h3>October 11, 2017</h3>
					<p>Eric Mattison</p>
					</p>emattison@gmail.com</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						BTW, Mea Culpa.  I screwed up and got the date wrong for last month's meeting.  I will endeavor to deliver The Best ABCD Talk Ever to make up for my transgression.

					<h2>Who is this guy?</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						So who am I, anyway?

				<section>
					<p><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/emattison">I was once like you.</a></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						(Before I became this horrible twisted thing.)<br><br>
						Look!  I found my Scholar website!  That takes me back.  Also, that's probably the best photo anyone has ever taken of me.<br><br>

						In fact, I used to be one of the organizers for ABCD-WWW.<br><br>

						But then I sold my soul to Mammon/Big Pharma.  Now I work at Vertex Pharmaceuticals building internal web apps.  I would have a slide with the Vertex logo, or a photo of our building downtown, but our legal department requires a review of the disclosure of any of our intellectual property.<br><br>
						
						So no logos. And no disclosure of anything sensitive.  Sorry.<br>

					<h3>Huh?</h3>
					<p>I thought you were here to talk about IoT at Vertex.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Well, sorta.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Every year Vertex has a hackathon, where groups of IT folks gather and are presented with a challenge.  IoT had been a hot topic for a bit, so we thought, "Let's give the teams an IoT challenge".  Gradually, this morphed from "Let's do something with Raspberry Pis" to "Let's do something with Raspberry Pis and eggs" to "Let's remotely control Pis to cook eggs" to "And bacon!  And Toast!"  And thus the idea for IoT Breakfast was born.<br><br>
					Later, when I told Raman about our hackathon, he said, "Cool!  Can you give an ABCD talk about it?"  And since saying no to Raman is like kicking a puppy, here I am.

					<h3>Challenge 1: Sorting Eggs</h3>
					<p>How can I tell if an egg is uncooked or hard-boiled?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					The first challenge we gave our teams was to present them with a basket of eggs, some of which were hard-boiled and some were uncooked, and they had to sort them. Any ideas about how you would do this?<br><br>
					Ok, now how would you make a machine that could do this?<br><br>
					We decided to use the "candling" technique. 
					</aside>
				</section>		

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/pi.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					In our case, the idea was to develop a means where a machine could do the determination, and notify us remotely.  So we took a Raspberry Pi (1)...
					</aside>

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/photoresistor.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					...and connected it to a photoresistor (2). Now here's the really technical part:

        				Now, using some python code shamelessly stolen from Adafruit's website, we can read how opaque a given egg is.  Especially when a flashlight was shined on them, hardboiled eggs had a significantly higher value, which meant they were blocking more light.

					<h3>Challenge 2: Cooking the Raw Eggs</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					In a lab setting, how do you boil an egg?  With this:

				</section>	

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/hotplate.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Raise your hand if you know what this is.<br><br>
					This is a stirrer-hot plate.  We can heat up a solution and stir it at the same time.  As you can see, there are nobs and displays to operate the device manually.  But what you can't see is that there is a serial port on the back.  We were able to hook up the serial port to a raspberry pi.  Here's the awesome part: not only could you read the temperature data from the probe or see how fast the stirrer was spinning, you could also issue commands!  Which is probably a really bad idea to do remotely.  But we did it anyway. Because extremely hot liquid overflowing the sides of a beaker is hilarious.
					</aside>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<h3>Challenge 3: Make Toast</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
					Finally, we decided that we needed toast with our eggs.  By the way, I was all for cooking bacon as well.  But bacon was deemed A) too difficult to deal with and B) culturally insensitive to our muslim, jewish and vegetarian coworkers.					
					</aside>
				</section>	

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/toaster.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					So we bought a few of the cheapest toasters off Amazon and encouraged folks to modify them so a servo could depress and release the lever.  By the way, is there a name for that thing?  Toaster lever?<br><br>
					Again, the idea was to hook a Pi up to the servo and have it operate the toaster remotely.  Amazingly, only one toaster exploded and an acceptable number of Vertexians were injured.

				<section>
					<p><img src="/images/api.jpg"></p>
					<aside class="notes">
					And of course (Of Course!) I created an API for the devices to talk to.  Thus adding "The Internet" to the Internet of Things.

					<h3>IoT</h3>
					<p>Just another buzzword?</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Is the term "IoT" just another buzzword like Web 2.0, Big Data, and the Mobile Web?<br><br>
					To answer this question, let's take a step back and think about IoT more generally.

					<p>"Things"</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					What's a thing?  Here's a brick.  That's a thing.  Please pass that around.<br><br>
					Feel it, smell it, listen to it.  It's definitely a thing.<br><br>
					I love that even bricks have branding now.  So incredibly capitalistic and American.

					<p class="fragment">(Freakin')<p>
					<aside class="notes">
					(Hold up ethernet cable)  Here's the internet.  So if we attach the ethernet cable to the brick, we get an Internet thing.<br><br>
					But this way of connecting is becoming increasingly obsolete, to the extent that my mac doesn't even have an ethernet port.  Nowadays, you're supposed to be connecting wirelessly.<br><br>
					I'm only partially joking here. (NEXT)<br><br>
					In Normandy, France, the world's first testbed solar road installed to the tune of roughly five million dollars.  And who can forget (NEXT)<br><br>
					Solar Roadways.  Sorry, I'm mispronouncing that.  (Click on link)<br><br>
					(NEXT)
					Ok, so Solar Freakin' Roadways turns out to be prohibitively expensive as the pilot installation in Sandpoint, Idaho cost roughly 60,000 dollars to install 30 panels.  And apparently they de-laminate in code weather, which I'm sure isn't a problem in Idaho.  
					<br><br>
					Also, apparently the fuse box caught fire.  But that's ok because an Iron Maiden fan in Australia was watching the Solar Roadways webcam, and he was able to alert the fire department.  In my imagination, he was listening to "Run to the Hills" at the time.  The Internet of Bricks has built-in failsafes it seems.

 					First created to calculate artillery trajectories.  It could calculate a shell trajectory in 30 seconds what would take a human 20 hours.  Hooray!<br><br>
 					It was later used to test the feasability of a thermonuclear bomb.  Double hooray!

 						<p class="fragment">Cost $487,000<br><br>($6,740,000 in 2016 dollars)</p>
 					<aside class="notes">
 					Ok, some stats. (Click through)<br>
 					- A lot of power<br>
 					- Not terribly mobile<br>
 					- Fast for its day, but would have trouble displaying a youtube video<br>
 					- About 6,740 times the cost of the latest iPhone.  And when you think about it that way, what are you waiting for?  Go grab yourself an iPhone 10 and start designing nukes on the cheap!<br>
