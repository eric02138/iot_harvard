Who I am
- Used to be one of you.  Worked at Harvard Research Computing. Then I sold my soul.
- Now work at Vertex Pharmaceuticals on internal applications that I can't talk about without first going through Legal.

Why am I here?
- Vertex is excited about the prospects of IoT, especially in Lab monitoring and control.
- We had our yearly hackathon with an IoT theme that I helped organize.  The theme was "Vertex Breakfast"
- Had teams remotely sort eggs (raw vs cooked) and make toast

How do you tell if an egg is Cooked?
- Hook a photoresistor up to a Raspberry Pi, cover that with a toilet paper roll, and cover that with an egg.  Then shine a bright light on the egg.  Light will (partially) pass through the raw egg and the overall resistance number will be less.

Let's start with "Things"
- pass a brick around
That's a thing.

Moving on to "The Internet"
- show an ethernet cable
That's the Internet
My coworker Saul did an IoT presentation that focused almost entirely on "of".  We'll wave our hands at "of".

Wrap the ethernet cable around the brick: "Internet of Things"
- Not quite as absurd as it seems.  Remember Solar Roadways?

  - glowing orb that informs you on weather, stock market, etc.
Various things around us that we might not think of as networkable maybe at some point
The carpet might sense weight and adjust the lights appropriately
The microphone might do voice recognition and alter the network settings of the room when I say "As you can see in this video..."
The power outlets in the room might inform facilities when someone is vacuuming, etc.
